Compiling
-------------------
You need the Boost C++ Libraries. On Debian-based systems run `sudo apt-get install libboost-dev`.

Run
$ make

The compiled binary will be created in a new bin/ directory.
Successfully compiled on Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit with GCC 4.4.3.

Usage
-------------------
$ ./3dc input_type input_file output_type output_file

Where input_type and output_type is one of:
"stl", "stlb", or "obj"

Known Issues
-------------------
Reading and writing of binary STL files is handled in a way that is not
platform-independant. This may cause issues on some systems. The application
has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 10.10 32-bit.

There is occasionally an issue with reading the correct number of triangles
from a binary STL file. The file will still translate correctly, but a warning
will be displayed during conversion.

The OBJ parser does not currently support materials or textures.
