Compiling
-------------------
Requires a C++17 compiler. No external dependencies.

Run
$ make

The compiled binary will be created in a new bin/ directory.

Usage
-------------------
$ ./3dc input_type input_file output_type output_file

Where input_type and output_type is one of:
"stl", "stlb", or "obj"

OBJ Format Limitations
-------------------
All geometry is triangulated on output. N-gon faces are triangulated using
ear clipping during import.

The following OBJ features are not supported:
- Object names (o) and groups (g) are ignored
- Smoothing groups (s) are ignored
- Negative vertex indices not supported
- Line (l) and point (p) elements not supported
- Free-form geometry (curves, surfaces) not supported
- Texture map options in MTL files are ignored
- Per-vertex colors not supported
